[FREE] ESX Bong Script

# About
This is a simple bong script that is targetable for any bong on the map you can change/add/remove your props in the Config.lua

You can make it where they have to pay to smoke the bong or they dont in the Config.lua

You will get a high effect from smoking the Bong

# Plans
I plan to make a option where you can choose to use it with a prop using ox_target or use it as a item through your inventory

I also plan to add a smoke effect after hitting the Bong

These will likely get done with in the next few weeks i made this very fast so if you find any bugs dm me on Discord my discord is solixfs
